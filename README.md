# Learning-React-Native, Android App Dev, Web Dev, Game Dev, Cyber Attack Protector. 
My First Time Touching React Native. 

1. Installing React Native. First I need to download Node, Later I download expo go on my device or I Could Even Download Android Stimulator on my pc to be able to run it on android since I do not use android. 


2. Here's the link in installing expo on your device after downloading node. npm i -g expo-cli... For my device, This didn't work so I download KALI LINUX on my device through the microsoft app store. I installed SUDO and Make my account with my own Password. Then, I installed Expo. Through My main pannel. not in a folder... I installed it openly... Example, Inside my "THIS PC" Folder. so it will be accessable everywhere. The installation is Sudo npx install -g (which is "Global") expo-cli... And Whala. It installed successfully... The main reason why I installed it in the "THIS PC" folder is, When ever I want to use Expo, I'll just Type in my terminal after navigating to the folder where i want to program my app, Say. expo init MyNewApp.

3. HELLO! Welcome to the expirences I go through, Through my course To become a Mobile App Developer, Cyber Attack Protector, Web Dev, Databases, Game Developer...
